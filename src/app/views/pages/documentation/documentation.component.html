              In 2017, Tadge Dryja published a paper on Discreet Log Contracts.

              By creating a Discreet Log Contract, Alice can form a contract paying Bob some time in the future, based on preset conditions,
              without committing any details of those conditions to the blockchain. Therefore it is discreet in the sense that no external
              observer can learn its existence from the public ledger. This contract depends on an external entity or entities publishing a
              signed message at some point in the future (before the expiration of the contract). The contents of this signed message
              determine the division of the funds committed to the contract. This external entity is called an “oracle”. Using Discreet Log
              Contracts, the signature published by the oracle gives each participant of the contract the possibility to claim the amount
              from the contract that is due him without the need for cooperation from the other party.

              In order to act as a participant in a Discreet Log Contract, an oracle must use a private/public cryptographic key pair. The
              private key is used in conjunction with a unique one-time-signing key for each message. The private key of the oracle never
              changes, and its public key is incorporated into Discreet Log Contracts that people form.

              the R value is committed in advance of the signature being calculated; the message to be signed is not yet known, but a nonce
              has been chosen and an R point published. (This prevents the use of some deterministic nonce schemes such as RFC6979).
